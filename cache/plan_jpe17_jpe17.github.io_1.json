  "summary": "Fix skills progress bar animation flickering by ensuring proper initial state management and removing problematic timeout delays. The issue occurs because progress bars don't start at 0% width and the 300ms timeout in animateSkillBar() causes bars to briefly appear at full width before animating, creating a jarring flicker and backward movement effect.",
