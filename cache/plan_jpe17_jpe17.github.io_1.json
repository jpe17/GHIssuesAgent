  "summary": "Fix skills progress bar animation flicker by removing the problematic 300ms setTimeout and ensuring proper initial state. The issue occurs because progress bars start with an undefined width, get animated via CSS transitions, but the 300ms delay in JavaScript causes a visual glitch where bars appear to move backwards before completing their animation.",
