  "summary": "Fix skills progress bar animation flicker by eliminating timing conflicts between JavaScript timeout and CSS transitions. The issue occurs because the animateSkillBar function uses a 300ms setTimeout before setting the final width, which conflicts with the 1s CSS transition, causing bars to flicker and move backwards during animation.",
