  "body": "# Bug: Skills progress bars flicker and move backwards during animation\n\n## Description\nWhen the skills section loads and the progress bars animate, there's a visual glitch where the bars appear to flicker once and move backwards slightly before completing their animation. This creates a jarring user experience that detracts from the professional appearance of the portfolio.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the skills section of the portfolio\n2. Scroll down to trigger the skills section animation\n3. Observe the progress bars as they animate from 0% to their target percentage\n4. Notice the flicker and backward movement during the animation\n\n## Expected Behavior\nProgress bars should smoothly animate from 0% to their target percentage without any flickering or backward movement.\n\n## Current Behavior\nProgress bars flicker and move backwards once during the animation sequence.\n\n## Technical Details\n- The issue occurs in the skill bar animation function\n- The animation uses a timeout before setting the final width\n- The flicker likely occurs due to the initial state not being properly set before the animation begins\n\n## Priority\nMedium\n\n## Labels\n- bug\n- animation\n- ui/ux ",
