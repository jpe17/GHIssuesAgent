    "feasibility_rationale": "Very high feasibility due to: (1) Video file already exists in static/videos/, (2) Well-structured codebase with clear section patterns, (3) Existing CSS custom properties and glass-morphism styling system, (4) Standard HTML5 video implementation required, (5) Clear insertion point identified between experience and contact sections",
    "complexity_rationale": "Low complexity because: (1) Standard HTML5 video element implementation, (2) Existing CSS patterns can be reused, (3) No complex JavaScript interactions required beyond basic play/pause, (4) Responsive design patterns already established, (5) Fade-in animations already implemented via IntersectionObserver",
